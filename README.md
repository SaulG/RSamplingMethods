# RSamplingMethods
In this homework I did apply two sampling techniques: Simple random sampling without replacement and Stratified sampling. The two sampling techniques are available through the library "sampling" of R, and the dataset was provided by the professor. In order to explore the dataset I did use boxplots, histograms and a matrix of Pearson's correlations (using the library corrgram).
