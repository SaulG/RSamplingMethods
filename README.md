# Sampling Methods on R
In this homework I did apply two sampling techniques: Simple random sampling without replacement and Stratified sampling. The two sampling techniques are available through the sampling's library of R, and the dataset was provided by the professor. In order to explore the dataset I used boxplots, histograms and a matrix of Pearson's correlations with scatterplots (using the corrgram's library).
